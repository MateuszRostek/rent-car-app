## Setup Instructions
Ensure you have Docker and JDK installed  
In this project, I've used `Docker Desktop 4.28.0 (139021)` and `Oracle OpenJDK version 20.0.2`

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Verify you have Docker Engine running.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run `./mvnw clean package` to create a .jar file.
5. In the .env file you should provide the necessary DB and Docker variables, here is an example:  
```mysql
MYSQLDB_USER=1234
MYSQLDB_PASSWORD=1234
MYSQLDB_DATABASE=1234

JWT_SECRET=1234

TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=1234

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=1234

MYSQLDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=1234
MYSQLDB_LOCAL_PORT=1234
MYSQLDB_DOCKER_PORT=1234

SPRING_LOCAL_PORT=1234
SPRING_DOCKER_PORT=1234
DEBUG_PORT=1234
```
(Do you want to fully test my API? Please contact me at: rostek.mateusz@outlook.com for actual .env file)  

6. Run `docker compose up -d --build` to start the application and MySQL database.  
7. Feel free to test my application using Postman/Swagger.  
   **Postman**: Keep in mind that you have to pass the Authorization (Bearer Token) that you receive when logging in.  
  Do you want to test admin features? Here are the credentials of the sample manager:  
   ```json
   {
   "email": "john@manager.com",
   "password": "12345678"
   }
   ```
   And also, the credentials of the sample customer:
   ```json
   {
   "email": "paul@customer.com",
   "password": "12345678"
   }
   ```
8. To stop and remove containers use `docker compose down`.

## Challenges Encountered

Working with the Stripe API was a bit challenging, requiring careful setup to ensure a proper connection and secure handling of financial data. This project was quite robust, requiring careful management of various components such as user authentication, rental processing, and real-time notifications. Coordinating these different elements while maintaining data consistency and security added complexity. Ultimately, I am proud of this project and the valuable lessons I learned while developing it.
